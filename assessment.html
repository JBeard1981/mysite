<h1>Project Analysis</h1>

<strong>Client: </strong> Krymsun Midnight<br>
<strong>Project: </strong> Redesign of Krymsun Studios web portal<br>
<strong>Designer: </strong> Jonathan Beard<br>


<h3>Site Intent</h3>

<p>The intent of the site is to provide a web outlet for IMVU based photography company called "Krymsun Studios". This is not a real business and no real money changes hands. It is simply designed to create profile pictures and virtual items for use with IMVU software</p>

<h4>Client Goals</h4>
<p>The client has specific goals in mind for the site. Since the site is for a photography group, even one based in a game, there are a few things that are a required.<p>
<ul>
<li>Provide clear and concise description of the services provided.</li>

<li>Provide a listing of available posing options.</li>

<li>Provide an easily understandable appointment application. </li>

<li>Provide examples of previously completed works.</li>

<li>Provide a current and accurate listing of prices for the various services provided.</li>
</ul>
<h4>User Goals</h4>

<p>Goals for users are simple.</p>

<ul>
<li>Site should be easily navigated.</li>

<li>Information provided should be easy to follow and understand.</li>

<li>Site should be simple yet engaging.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Competitive Analysis</h3>

<p>I have worked with various IMVU photo editing groups in the past. I have noticed that the main problem with these programs is that there are no sites for them. I believe this mostly to be because it is based in a video game and does not exist in the real world. Since the photo edit service is based in the game there is no real money changing hands. And their for no money to pay for web hosting.</p>

<h3>Target Audience</h3>

<p>Our target audience includes both your average player and content creators.</p>

<h4>Player Profile</h4>
<p>Sara is your average teen. She has been plying IMVU for a while and has lots of friends. She wants to have a picture made of her and her friends to hang in her virtual room in IMVU.</p>

<h4>Creator Profile</h4>
<p>Jon has been creating content for IMVU for a while. He has been searching for a picture frame to use to create a new poster for a friend. Since Krymsun Studios provides meshes for other developers to derive from this is the perfect place for him to look.</p>
