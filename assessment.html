<h1>Project Analysis</h1>

<strong>Client: </strong> Jonathan Beard<br>
<strong>Project: </strong> Website Design from Ground up<br>
<strong>Designer: </strong> Jonathan Beard<br>


<h3>Site Intent</h3>

<p>The intentions of this sight are to provide rules and regulations for the play of a new text based roleplaying game entitled “Eternal Sacrament” to take place in aol chat rooms. </p>

<h4>Client Goals</h4>
<p>I have few client goals for the site. Since this is a game that takes place in another platform not much is required beyond presentation and organization. My client goals are as follows :<p>
<ul>
<li>Provide clear listing of rules and regulations for the play of the game. These rules will include what can and cannot be done in game, what character races are permitted to be played, and how things must be done in order to be ruled as valid in the game.</li>

<li>Provide a clear listing of current members of the game. </li>

<li>Provide a clear and easily understood application to join the game community. </li>

<li>Provide a clean and professional looking layout for the site.</li>
</ul>
<h4>User Goals</h4>

<p>As a user there are a few key things that I would want to see in a game/site such as this. These are things that I have noticed are poorly done or neglected in other such sites.</p>

<ul>
<li>Site should be easily navigated.</li>

<li>Information provided should be easy to follow and understand.</li>

<li>Site should be simple yet engaging.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Competitive Analysis</h3>

<p>I have been involved in various role playing groups in the past. I have noticed there are some of the same problems with the websites for these various games. There are a few issues I have come across in my years of role play that seem to be standards practice.</p>

<ul>
<li>Lack of responsive design</li>
<li>Overly complex rules</li>
<li>Poor color choice</li>
<li>Poor navigation design</li>
</ul>


<h4>Group 1 : <a href=”http://www.crimsondiva.net/satanicblack/” target="new">Satanic Black</a></h4>

</p>This rp group has long since died out but their website is still available. I believe what led to the downfall of this group is a mixture of many of the listed issues above. First and foremost is the responsive design. The page does alter itself with the changing of the window size however the responsiveness is poor. Expanded to the size of my screen things over lap blocking view of quite a bit of information. You have to resize the window down to roughly 800x600 to view it properly. Second we have poor navigation. The site is made up of countless pages slapped together through a series of various links that bring you to more long lists of links. It could literally take you hours to find the information you are looking for if you do not know where to look. Finally… Overly complicated rules. The rules of this game are so complex that you need a collage degree to make sense of it. The one thing I have to say that this site has going for it is a good contrast in colors that make the site easy to read.</p>

<h4>Group 2 : <a href=”http://ciwe.net/thecrimsonstar/index.html” target="new">OCS : Order of the Crimson Star</a>

<p>This rp group, much to my surprise, is still active. I have been involved in this group myself a few years back and I must say I enjoyed my time there but ultimately I left because of a lack of activity. For the most part the people are kind and fun to hang out with. As for their web site design I have to admit there are a few minor issues.  First of all is the choice of colors in their design. The rather low amount of contrast makes some parts of the sight near impossible to read. This makes it exceptionally difficult for anyone who has visual impairments to get a full understanding of the site information. Second is a complete and total lack of responsive design. The site does not change with the browser. This causes some problems with easily missing information if you do not have it set at the proper screen resolution. </p>

<h3>Target Audience</h3>

<p>Our target audience includes both beginner and experienced role players who are looking for a change in pace. The site will include reference guides for common role play terms such as OOC and IRL as well as detailed descriptions of how things are to be done in the game without over complicating it.</p>

<h4>Beginner Profile</h4>
<p>Sara is still in high school and looking for something to do in her down time that involves one of her favorite past times... Writing. Some of her friends have been telling her how role play can help her develop better creative writing skills.</p>

<h4>Experienced Profile</h4>
<p>Jon has been role playing for many years and is fed up with the mile long stat sheets and novel length pages of rules. Jon has been looking for a new place to play that focuses more on having fun and less on fussing because someone isn’t doing things the way someone else things it should be done.</p>
