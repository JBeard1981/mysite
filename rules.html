    <p>
      Here you will find a short list of rules. These rules are simple and easy to follow. Breaking these rules will not be tolerated.
    </p>
    <p>
      All groups nomatter how large or small must have rules. Rules to govern how things are done. Rules to determine what can and can not be done. Rules to bring order to the chaos.

    <h2>Rules to Live by</h2>
    <hr>
    <ol>
    	<li>Three Strikes. First and formost is our three strike rule. Should you break any of the rules listed here there are consequences. First time you will get a warning from one of the forum heads. Second time you will be placed on probation. Third strike and you are out. You will be banned from any RP chat associated with ES.</li>
    	<li>CRP (cross role play) will not be tolerated. Please check the dictionary page for an explanation of what crp is if you do not already know.</li>
    	<li>Drama is ok in small doses. However, when your drama gets to the point that it is causing problems for other players then you will be contacted by a forum leader.</li>
    	<li>Mun Bashing will not be tolerated. If you have a problem with another player keep it to yourself. I will say this only one time. <strong>DO NOT</strong> talk about other players behind their backs. This is one type of drama that we will not tolerate.</li>
    	<li>To play is to consent. When you are in an Eternal Sacrament room you will play by our rules. This however, does not mean you have no choice. If you do not agree with something that someone is doing to your character you do not have to accept it. Unless of course the thing that you dont like is a forum regulated attempt against your character. For definations of such attempts please see the charters page</li>
