      Here you will find some absolutely ridiculous things about role playing. Mostly these are just all silly and cliche things that many people find themselves doing. As funny as it all seems you would be suprised how true it ends up being when you go into many role playing chat rooms especially those associated with Rhy'Din. Rhy'Din was an extremely popular text based roleplaying game hosted by AOL.

<li>You need no food to sustain you. . .only liquor. </li>
