<h1>Project Analysis</h1>

<strong>Client: </strong> Jonathan Beard<br>
<strong>Project: </strong> Website Design from Ground up<br>
<strong>Designer: </strong> Jonathan Beard<br>


<h3>Site Intent</h3>

<p>The site will be designed as an information hub for a textually based role playing game called “Eternal Sacrament”. The focus will be providing clear and concise information about the various rules of game play. The location of Chat rooms where the game will take place, and detailed descriptions of the environment of the role play. </p>


<h3>Competitive Analysis</h3>

<p>I have been involved in various role playing groups in the past. I have noticed there are some of the same problems with the websites for these various games. The main issue I have come across is that most all of them are lacking in responsive web design. A prime example of this is the website for the rp forum “Satanic Black” the website was designed for use with AOL software without any thought that someone may use another program to view it. If you visit the site in a different program you will notice that the navigation menu overlaps the main content making it difficult if not impossible to read certain parts of the information. </p>

<p>In the case of the website for the OCS, The Order of the Crimson Star, the layout is set up in such a way that the background makes it difficult to read some of the information. Also the font choice is so small that it is difficult to read on larger displays. </p>

<ul>
<li><a href=”http://www.crimsondiva.net/satanicblack/”>Satanic Black</a></li>

<li><a href=”http://ciwe.net/thecrimsonstar/index.html”>OCS : Order of the Crimson Star</a></li>
</ul>

<h3>Target Audience</h3>

<p>Our target audience is extremely varied. I have known role players as young as 13 and as old as 65.  We are not targeting a specific age group. However, what we are targeting are people with certain interests. Those interests being reading writing and medieval fantasy.</p>
