<p>A charter is a set of rules set forth to govern the use of special items or defigne how certain things are to be done.</p>   
    <p>
To put it a little more simply... If there is a role you want to take on that requires special skills such as assassination or healing this is where you find out how. Other laws are listed here such as how experience is gained and applied within the realm and how to use dice.

    <h2 align=”center”><u>Dice Chater</u></h2>
	<p>Here in Eternal Sacrament we use a mortality based dice system. However we do not use the usual run of the mill 2, 3, 4d system that everyone has. Our system instead has two extra levels of mortality, Demigod, and God.</p>
	<p>Demigods and gods are not openly playable as everyone would want to play a demigod or god and use the 5d or 6d roll strength to bully everyone else. Before being granted Demigod dice you must first start out with mortal Halfling or immortal dice and be active. This way we know a little about your character and yourself and prove that you are not going to abuse the power given. I can’t tell you how many times I have seen a character gain power and then use it to tear down a SL. </p>
	<p>If you wish to upgrade your mortality dice you must first reach the upper limits of your current mortality. The basic idea is to become stronger you must work for it.  There are ways around this however. Should you want to upgrade your mortality without grinding out experience you can apply for a mortality upgrade by sending a message to the forum heads. <p>
