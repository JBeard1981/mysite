    <h2 align=”center”>Welcome to Eternal Sacrament</h2>

<p>Eternal Sacrament (ES) is a text based rpg (role playing game) that takes place in various chat programs including aol, yahoo, msn, imvu, and browser based chat rooms.  Here in ES we follow by the KISS method of government. Keep It Simple Stupid. The main issue I have found with many role playing groups is that they over complicate things. We have found that you do not need a thousand pages of complex rules and regulations. You don’t have to earn your phd in theoretical physics or a masters degree in medieval literature to have a good time. Our laws are simple and structured to be easily understood. </p>

<p>Above all else our main focus is having fun. We come here to enjoy ourselves not to gripe about who is doing this right or that wrong. The leader ship of ES is not here to tell you how to play the game, we are just here to make sure everyone has fun. </p>
